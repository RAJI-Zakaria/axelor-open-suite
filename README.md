# Installing Axelor Using Docker

This guide provides a step-by-step solution for installing Axelor using Docker. After extensive research, I found that the available documentation is limited, and errors are common. Therefore, Iâ€™m sharing this solution in case someone finds it helpful.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Steps to Install

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RAJI-Zakaria/axelor-open-suite
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd axelor-open-suite
   ```
3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:7070`.

## Configuration Details

- PostgreSQL is configured with the following credentials:

  - **Username**: `axelor`
  - **Password**: `axelor`
  - **Database**: `axelor`

- Axelor application is exposed on port `7070`.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Database Connection Error**: Ensure the database container is running, and the credentials in `axelor-config.properties` match those in `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Port Conflict**: If port `7070` is already in use, update the port mapping in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
